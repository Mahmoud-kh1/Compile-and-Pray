#  Compile and Pray

> Hit **Scan**, shed a few tears, and watch your code get roasted in real time. 😭

##  What is this?

A **C Lexical Analyzer GUI** — basically a tool that takes your C code,  
shreds it into tiny colorful pieces, and calls it *analysis*.  

# It doesn’t fix your bugs, but it will definitely make you **question your life choices**.

##  How to use (Steps to Regret Everything)

1. Launch the app.  
2. Paste your fragile, sleep-deprived C code.  
3. Take a deep breath (or cry a little).  
4. Hit **Scan**.  
5. Watch the GUI proudly highlight your errors while you wipe away your tears.

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- `tkinter` (comes with Python)  
- Optional: `Pillow` (to make the banner look less depressing)  


##  Motto

> “Hit Scan.
